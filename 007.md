        def say_my_name(self):
            print(f"Mommy!")

    class Dad:

        def say_my_name(self):
            print(f"Daddy!")

    # Child class inheriting from Mum and Dad
    class Child(Mum, Dad):
        def say_parrent_name(self):
            super().say_my_name()

    Child().say_parrent_name()  # Do you know the answer?
