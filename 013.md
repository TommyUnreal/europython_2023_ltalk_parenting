```python
    import logging
    from PIL import Image

    logging.basicConfig(filename='child_log.txt', level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s: %(message)s')

    class Child:

        def record_temperature(temperature):
            logging.info(f"Child's temperature recorded: {temperature} Â°C")

        def capture_picture(activity):
            image = Image.new('RGB', (1920, 1080))
            image.save(f"child_{activity}.jpg")

    child.record_temperature(37.5)
    child.capture_picture("PlayingWithToys")
    child.capture_picture("TakingFirstSteps")
    child.capture_picture("Smiling")
