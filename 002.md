```python
    def simulate_night() -> None:
        child.wake_up()
        # Add milk to put the child to sleep
        child.add_milk()
        # Simulate some time passing ~ 3 hours
        time.sleep(10_800)
        # Put the child into deep sleep
        child.sleep()

        return None
