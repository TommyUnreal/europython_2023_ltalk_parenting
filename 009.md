# Parenting: Lessons Learned

## Lesson 7: It turned out that once the Child Process starts running, it random.shuffles any container in its scope. That's why you have the car keys in a toy box.

```python
    import random

    sock_drawer = ["sock1", "sock2", "sock3"]
    kitchen_cupboard = ["plate", "cup", "bowl"]
    toy_box = ["teddy bear", "ball", "blocks"]

    if child_process.is_running:
        all_elements = sock_drawer + kitchen_cupboard + toy_box
        random.shuffle(all_elements)

        sock_drawer, kitchen_cupboard, toy_box = [
            all_elements[i:i + 3]
            for i in range(0, len(all_elements), 3)
        ]

        # TODO: Implement sorting algorithm here.
